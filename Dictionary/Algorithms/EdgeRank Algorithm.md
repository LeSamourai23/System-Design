As of my last update in September 2021, "EdgeRank" was the name of the algorithm used by Facebook to determine the order in which posts appear in a user's News Feed. However, it's important to note that Facebook's algorithms are continuously evolving, and the company might have made changes or replaced EdgeRank with a different algorithm by now. Nevertheless, I'll provide an overview of EdgeRank based on the information available up to September 2021.

EdgeRank was designed to prioritize and display content that is most relevant to individual users, thereby creating a more personalized News Feed experience. It takes several factors into account when determining the order of posts:
```math
EdgeRank = Affinity Score + Weight * Time Decay + Interactions
```

1. **Affinity Score**: This refers to the relationship between the user and the content creator. If a user consistently engages with content from a specific person or page (likes, comments, shares, etc.), Facebook's algorithm assumes that the user has a higher affinity for that content, and it will be given more priority in their News Feed.

2. **Weight**: Different types of content carry different weights. For instance, videos and images may have higher weight than simple text posts. The more engaging and interactive a particular content type is, the higher its weight in the algorithm.

3. **Time Decay**: The recency of a post is also a crucial factor. The newer a post is, the more likely it is to appear higher in the News Feed. Older posts are more likely to lose visibility over time as new content is published.

4. **Interactions**: The number of interactions a post receives plays a significant role. The more likes, comments, and shares a post receives, the higher its likelihood of appearing in the News Feed of other users.

By considering these factors, EdgeRank attempts to determine the most relevant and engaging content for each user, with the ultimate goal of keeping users engaged on the platform and encouraging them to spend more time interacting with content.

Keep in mind that since my information is not up-to-date, it's possible that Facebook has made changes to this algorithm or implemented a completely different one to improve user experience and engagement on their platform.
