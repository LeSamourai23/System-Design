Webhooks are a way for web applications to communicate and exchange data with each other in real-time. They are a mechanism used by developers to receive automatic notifications or events from one web application (the sender) to another web application (the receiver) when specific actions or changes occur.

Here's a simple explanation of how webhooks work:

1. **Setup**: The receiver of the webhook provides a unique URL (also known as a webhook endpoint) where it can receive incoming data.

2. **Event Occurs**: The sender application generates an event or triggers a specific action. For example, this could be a new order placed, a file uploaded, or a status change in a task.

3. **Notification**: Once the event occurs, the sender application sends a POST request to the webhook endpoint URL of the receiver application. The POST request contains relevant data about the event.

4. **Handling the Webhook**: The receiver application receives the POST request at the specified webhook endpoint. It then processes the incoming data and takes appropriate actions based on the information received. This could involve updating a database, sending notifications, or triggering other processes.

Webhooks are commonly used in various scenarios, such as:

- **Real-time Notifications**: Instantly notifying a user or application when certain events happen, e.g., sending a notification to a user's mobile device when they receive a new message.

- **Integration between Applications**: Enabling two different applications to communicate and exchange data seamlessly, e.g., updating a CRM system when a new lead is generated on a website.

- **Automated Workflows**: Automating processes based on external events, e.g., triggering a build process when code is pushed to a version control system.

Compared to traditional polling (where an application repeatedly checks for updates), webhooks provide a more efficient and real-time way of getting event-driven data. However, implementing and handling webhooks requires both the sender and receiver applications to understand the webhook's structure and ensure secure and reliable communication between them.
