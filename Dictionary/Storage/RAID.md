RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a way of storing the same data on multiple hard disks or solid-state drives (SSDs) to protect data in the case of a drive failure.

There are different RAID levels, however, and not all have the goal of providing redundancy. Let's discuss some commonly used RAID levels:

- **RAID 0**: Also known as striping, data is split evenly across all the drives in the array.
- **RAID 1**: Also known as mirroring, at least two drives contains the exact copy of a set of data. If a drive fails, others will still work.
- **RAID 5**: Striping with parity. Requires the use of at least 3 drives, striping the data across multiple drives like RAID 0, but also has a parity distributed across the drives.
- **RAID 6**: Striping with double parity. RAID 6 is like RAID 5, but the parity data are written to two drives.
- **RAID 10**: Combines striping plus mirroring from RAID 0 and RAID 1. It provides security by mirroring all data on secondary drives while using striping across each set of drives to speed up data transfers.

### Comparison

Let's compare all the features of different RAID levels:

|Features|RAID 0|RAID 1|RAID 5|RAID 6|RAID 10|

|Description|Striping|Mirroring|Striping with Parity|Striping with double parity|Striping and Mirroring|
|Minimum Disks|2|2|3|4|4|
|Read Performance|High|High|High|High|High|
|Write Performance|High|Medium|High|High|Medium|
|Cost|Low|High|Low|Low|High|
|Fault Tolerance|None|Single-drive failure|Single-drive failure|Two-drive failure|Up to one disk failure in each sub-array|
