Hashing is a technique used to convert data of arbitrary size into a fixed-size value called a hash code. Simple hashing is a straightforward method that involves applying basic operations to the input data to generate the hash code.

## Method

1. **Select Hash Function:** Choose a simple hash function that performs basic operations on the input data, such as addition, bitwise XOR, or multiplication.
2. **Apply Hash Function:** Apply the selected hash function to the input data to produce the hash code.
3. **Fixed Size Output:** The hash code generated by simple hashing will have a fixed size, regardless of the size of the input data.
4. **Collision Risk:** Simple hashing may lead to hash collisions, where different input data produces the same hash code. Collision handling strategies like chaining or open addressing may be needed.

## Formula

```math
ServerIndex = hash{key} % N
```
where,
N is the size of the servers

Here, when one of the server goes down, there is a significant amount of keys which get redistributed, resulting in a hit to the performance.
